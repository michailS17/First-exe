array(string) is a group of serious memory location 
its a concecuative memory location with same name and type
allows as to save multiple values at the same time
     array is a numeric data
     string is a non numeric data or group of characters
array is a derived data type which is built up on primitive datatype
characterestics- they both use collective name(identifier) 
              - length(size) is always >=2
              -elements(the values to be stored)
              -index(subscript)- the reference of an individual item(elements) starts from zero
advantages
-store large numbers with single name
-used to process may values
limitation 
-static memory allocation(you cant change it once its located)
two types of array
1. 1D - horizontal or vertical row
2. multiple Dimension- it can be 2D(excel),3D,4D
 
1.declare an array to store 10 persons height, weight and bmi
2.declare an array to store a marks on of 50 students for 5 subjects
3 declare an array to store a daily temperature for one week hint (daily temp contain the min max and average)

strings
is a collection of characters in a memory space
usually a meaningful sequence
anything with "" quote
empty string ""
have no special data type to store strings it uses char                                   
strings are always terminated and last element is always a null character "\0"

 string declaration two types
 c style of decalration string(array style)
 -char stringname[size];   1D string
 -char stringname[rsize][csize]; 2d string
 C++ style (user defined)
 -uses <srting.h> library and uses string datatype 
 -string mystring,country;
 -string adress[10][10] ; 2D string
 -size allocation after runtime
 -uses agregate operation unlike array
*it can optimize size while initialization
char adress[]="addis ababa, ethiopia";
*initalizing every character{'s','d','\0'};
2d initialization
char word[5][4]={"cat","dog","rat","ox"};

string libraries for c and c++ style or string for c and c++ type???
